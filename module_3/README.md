# Module 3: Processes and Configuration

### Learning Objectives
1. TBD

## 1. Configutation
* Look at [nextflow.config](nextflow.config)
* When a file named `nextflow.config` is present in the same directory as a nextflow script, it provides project-level configuration to be used when running that script. 
* Look at `~/.nextflow/config`. This provides system wide nextflow configuration, and is tailored to Milton/SLURM (it was created when you loaded the nextflow module).
* Any settings provided by both the system wide `~/.nextflow/config` and project `nextflow.config` are overridden by the project `nextflow.config` 
* see https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html

## 2. Scripts (bin) (TBD)
